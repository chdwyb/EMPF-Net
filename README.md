###  An Encoder-free Multi-axis Physics-aware Fusion Network for Remote Sensing Image Dehazing

**Abstract**: Current methods for remote sensing image dehazing confront noteworthy computational intricacies and yield suboptimal dehazed outputs, thereby circumscribing their pragmatic applicability. To this end, we propose EMPF-Net, a novel encoder-free multi-axis physics-aware fusion network that exhibits both lightweight characteristics and computational efficiency. In our approach, we contend that conventional u-shaped networks allocate substantial computational resources to encode haze-degraded features, which play a subordinate role in the reconstruction process. Consequently, our encoder stages solely incorporate down-sampling operations. To reduce the computational load and enhance generalization capabilities, we devise a multi-axis partial queried learning block (MPQLB) that primarily concentrates on learning feature dimension-wise queries, rather than relying solely on strictly-correlated input feature content. Furthermore, we augment the reconstruction process by incorporating ground truth supervision into each stage via a supervised cross-scale transposed attention module (SCTAM). It calculates attention maps under the guidance of haze-free images, thereby suppressing less informative features to propagate to the subsequent level. In addition, to tackle the challenge of ineffective intral-level feature fusion strategies, which result in insufficient elimination of haze-degraded information and subsequently negatively impact the quality of restored images, we introduce a physics-aware intra-level fusion module (PIFM). This module harnesses a physical inversion model to enhance feature interaction and foster more effective fusion of essential features. We evaluate our proposed EMPF-Net on 12 publicly available datasets. Extensive experimental results substantiate our superiority in terms of both metrical scores and visual quality, despite being equipped with a modest parameter count of 300 K. Our proposed approach surpasses the performance of existing methods and is readily accessible at https://github.com/chdwyb/EMPF-Net.
